## Sources

Sources that were utilized to develop this top level fitness application were as such. Youtube, Google, Reddit, Xpert Learning Assistant, coding blogs, w3schools, books on coding, course exercises, previous challenges, reaching out to faculty for support, tutoring sessions, and many many discord meetings after school hours. Among all the sources this application took a lot of time, hard work, patience and communication to complete. In the end, we as a team were able to create an application from the ground up. We hope you enjoy what we have created in reactFitness.

## Challenges

Our development journey with reactFitness was marked by several challenges, each of which our dedicated team tackled head-on to ensure a robust and seamless application. One significant hurdle involved establishing communication between the client side and the backend. Overcoming this challenge required meticulous coordination and troubleshooting to ensure the smooth flow of information between the user interface and the server.

Another key obstacle we encountered was the integration of mutations and queries with the Apollo server. Fine-tuning this process demanded a deep understanding of GraphQL and Apollo to ensure that data manipulations and retrievals functioned seamlessly. Our team's perseverance and collaborative problem-solving were pivotal in resolving these issues, resulting in an efficient and responsive data flow within the application.

Additionally, implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication posed its own set of challenges. Safeguarding user data and ensuring secure authentication required careful consideration of token generation, validation, and expiration. Our team worked diligently to implement JWT successfully, enhancing the overall security and reliability of reactFitness.

By overcoming these challenges, we not only strengthened our technical expertise but also refined the user experience, delivering a robust and reliable fitness application that meets the expectations of our users.

## Victories

* Operational JWT Authentication
    
    * One of our major triumphs in the development of reactFitness was the successful implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Enabling users to securely log in and authenticate their identity was a crucial milestone. This achievement not only ensures data security but also provides a seamless and reliable login experience for our users.

* Seamless Data Flow with Apollo and MongoDB

    * Achieving a smooth integration between our client-side mutations, Apollo server, and MongoDB was a significant accomplishment. Our team worked diligently to establish a robust data flow, allowing user records to be efficiently stored in MongoDB through Apollo. This victory enhances the reliability and performance of reactFitness, ensuring that user interactions are accurately recorded and seamlessly reflected in the backend.

* Solid Teamwork and Communication

    * Building a successful application isn't just about coding—it's about collaboration and communication. Our team's ability to work cohesively and communicate effectively played a pivotal role in overcoming challenges and achieving milestones. From problem-solving sessions to regular updates, our teamwork was instrumental in navigating the complexities of development and ensuring a successful outcome.

* Building a Pride-Worthy Web Application

    * From inception to implementation, the journey of building reactFitness was a labor of passion and dedication. We take pride in creating a web application from the ground up that not only meets functional requirements but also reflects our commitment to delivering a high-quality product. The result is an application that we, as a team, can confidently stand behind and share with pride. 
    
* In summary, these achievements represent the dedication, skill, and collaboration that define the success of reactFitness. We look forward to continued growth and the opportunity to enhance the application further based on user feedback and evolving technologies.
